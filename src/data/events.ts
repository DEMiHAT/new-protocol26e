    subtitle: "A Competitive Coding Challenge",
    description:
      "A high-energy, battle-royale-style coding competition where teams of 3-4 compete through multiple elimination rounds. All teams begin together in Round 1 (The Drop), solving basic coding and debugging tasks, with the weakest and slowest teams eliminated. Round 2 (The Shrinking Zone) increases time pressure and focuses on logic-heavy and moderate algorithmic problems like sorting, searching, and classic LeetCode-style challenges, allowing only the top half to advance. In the Final Showdown, remaining teams face advanced problem-solving under extreme time constraints, with teams eliminated one by one as others finish correct solutions-crowning the last team standing as the winner and the second-last as runner-up.",

      "Participants compete in teams through a sequence of interconnected tech puzzles, where solving one challenge unlocks the next clue or digital access toward the final escape. The challenges include debugging buggy code snippets (in C, Python, Java, or JavaScript) to uncover passwords or keys, decrypting messages using ciphers like Caesar, substitution, binary, or Base64 to reveal locations or locks, and solving logic puzzles that gradually increase in technical complexity-keeping the experience engaging for both beginners and experienced coders.",

    description:
      "This event is conducted for a maximum duration of two hours in the afternoon session and involves teams of 2-3 participants competing through multiple rounds of increasing difficulty. In each round, teams are presented with 2-4 images or visual clues that represent technical ideas, functions, or references. By logically connecting all the clues, teams must identify a single technical term, concept, or technology within a strict time limit of 30-60 seconds. Scoring is based on correctness and speed, with bonus points for the fastest valid responses. After each question, the correct connection is revealed with a brief technical explanation, and audience participation is allowed once teams have submitted their answers.",

    subtitle: "Board Game Challenge",
    description:
      "Code to the Upside Down begins with teams of one to three participants assembling on the board, with multiple teams playing at the same time. The game starts as teams take turns rolling the dice, and each roll moves the team forward by the corresponding number of tiles. Once a team lands on a tile, they must answer the technical question placed on that tile, which may be based on programming basics, logical reasoning, computer science fundamentals, or current technology trends. If the team answers correctly, they remain on that tile and wait for their next turn. If the answer is incorrect, the team moves back to its previous position. At this point, the question is opened to all other teams, and the first team to buzz in gets a chance to answer; a correct buzzer answer allows that team to move two steps forward. If a team rolls a five, they immediately receive an extra turn. This sequence continues as teams progress across the board, moving deeper into the Upside Down with every roll, until one team reaches the final tile and successfully escapes, winning the game.",
